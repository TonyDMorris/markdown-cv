## About Me
My name is Tony and I'm an avid programmer and proud father.

After working in the automotive industry and retail for a number of years.  
I decided to focus on something that has interested me for a long time.

After learning to code in javascript and becoming well-versed in a number of different tools and technologies along the way, I have discovered that I am a proficient and expedient learner and am able to solve complicated problems using these tools.

Following my attendance at NorthCoders all I can think about is what I am going to learn next and that I can't wait to get started.
